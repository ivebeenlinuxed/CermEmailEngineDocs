## What is the Gallery?

The gallery is a cloud service which allows you to directly download pre-made flows. Rather than developing something which has already been made, this allows you to quickly find something that suits your purpose. Any flow that is downloaded is completely editable, so you can take a flow which is nearly correct, then customise it for your business

## How do I access it?

1. Go to the CERM Flows Index
2. Click Gallery
3. Use the hashtags filters on the left to find flows in the categories you are interested in
4. Click "Install"
5. The editor will now open where you can edit this flow further
