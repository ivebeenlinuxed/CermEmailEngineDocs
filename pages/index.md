## Welcome to CERM Flows

The CERM Flows project is a beta flowchart tool. It originally began life to allow more complex emails to be sent, for example, as things were approved, or at the beginning of each day. As it evolved however it allowed consultants to design more complex automation, triggering actions after each other, and updating the database in a safe way.

As the project continues the roadmap is to support the CERM REST API team in making the API tools accessible and easy, particularly providing a framework to allow their use in scheduled tasks and hotfolders, which are regularly used systems in developing automation.

### 1. How to get involved?

In order to get involved, please speak to your CERM consultant about getting on the Beta trial

### 2. What does BETA mean?

The project is currently in a BETA stage. We are looking for volunteers who are willing to try out the tool. We do however make the following caviats:
 - The system is provided as-is. It is beta, it may not work sometimes.
 - The project may be discontinued. If it doesn't solve our customers needs, there is no point in continuing.
 - Those involved in the beta test must accept updates, even if this breaks existing flows.
 - Those involved in the beta will be required to provide feedback. Along with the previous point, we are innovating, and, in exchange for this free trial, we need you to provide feedback on its use
 - CERM may charge for this module in the future. We provide it free now, for trial. However, we think it is fair that if we make something, it should be paid for.
